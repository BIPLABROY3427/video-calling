# video-calling
A one-to-one WebRTC video calling setup enables real-time video and audio communication between two users directly through their browsers without needing plugins. This project uses WebRTC APIs, a signaling server (like Socket.io), and STUN/TURN servers to establish peer-to-peer connection for secure, low-latency calls.
